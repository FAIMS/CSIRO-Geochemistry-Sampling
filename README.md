# About this module:
This module was created for the **Capricorn Distal Footprints project**, based at Mineral Resources unit of CSIRO, Perth, Australia. The module has been designed to collect geosampling data in the remote parts of rural Western Australia. Different sampling teams collect data about water, rock, soil, and plant samples as well as take pictures, and GIS points using the FAIMS Mobile app.

## Authorship
This module was co-developed by Dr. Jens Klump and Dr. Nathan Reid at Mineral Resources unit of CSIRO and Drs. Adela Sobotkova and Brian Ballsun-Stanton at the FAIMS Project, Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University.

## Funding:
Development of this module was funded by CSIRO Mineral Resources, Kensington, WA

## Date of release:
March 2014

## FAIMS Mobile version
FAIMS **v2.2** (Android 5+)

## Access:
This module is part of the **FAIMS Demo library** on our publicly accessible Demo server (http://demo.fedarch.org/). 

## This module contains the following FAIMS features:
* dynamically growing lists for pH and Eh values in Water samples
* soft validation on Temperature and Conductivity field
* full GIS (map tab with basemaps, layers management and ability to manual create geometries)
* concatenated auto-incremented ID with textual prefix and a number
* dynamic UI on radiobutton selection
* coordinates from internal GPS
* hierarchical dropdowns
* controlled vocabularies

## This module can be used with no or minor modification for:
